# Starter JS

Starter template for JS projects.

## Development

* This is a web app built on HTML5, JavaScript and CSS.
* It uses Babel to transpile 'modern' ES6 code into 'current' (2016) JavaScript code.
* It uses Webpack to bundle JS files together. (Important for making the transpiled ES6 'import' functionality work.)
* Its also uses Stylus to make writing CSS easier.
* Developing the web app requires Node.js installed on your machine and a handy command line interface. (Bash, cmd.exe, etc)
* However, the _compiled_ web app itself can be run simply by opening the `index.html` in a web browser. (Chrome, Firefox, etc)

Project anatomy:

* Source JS (ES6 JavaScript) and STYL (Stylus CSS) files are in the `/src` folder.
* Compiled JS and CSS files are in the `/app` folder.
* Media assets are meant to be placed in the `/assets` folder, but this is optional.
* Entry point is `index.html`.

Starting the project:

1. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Run `npm start` to start the server.
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` on your browser to view the app.

Alternatively, there's a developer mode:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. `http://localhost:3000`
4. Changes to the JS and STYL files will now be compiled automatically; i.e. Babel/Webpack and Stylus now _watch_ the files. Refreshing the browser window should should show the latest edits.
